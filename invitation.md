Dear All,

the Frankfurt Open Science Initiative is happy to announce our upcoming Git Workshop held by Simon Schug on April 26, 2019.

Why Git?

**Version control**: Git keeps track of changes in your files and let's you go back in time if needed. 
Paired with an online repository, it helps you to transparently document the development of your models and data analysis pipelines and enables others to reproduce and reuse your work.

**Collaboration**: Github & Gitlab (and others) allow collaborators to seamlessly work together on the same project and code base without losing track of who did what and when. Additionally, they drastically facilitate sharing and maintaining of open source code and enable you to systematically deal with bugs and updates.


Feel free to look up more information here: https://open-science-frankfurt.github.io/category/news.html and register if you are interested and want to join the workshop (places are limited).
